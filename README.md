# Basically What is The ... ?
<h3>What is The Remote Cran Keylogger And The Offline Cran Keylogger ?</h3>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> When You Or Your Victim Don't Have Access To The Internet (Or No Port Forwarding Available) You Can Use The Offline Keylogger, It works by saving all keystrokes on victim's Machine, Then You Can Get All Keystrokes By Plugging A USB Storage Device Containing An Empty File Named <strong>cran.txt</strong> For 3 Seconds Then Unplugging It From Victim's Machine, This Will Automatically Request The Cran Keylogger For Keystrokes, After Keystrokes Are Successfully Copied To The USB Device, The Cran Keylogger Will Self Destroy itself.</p>
